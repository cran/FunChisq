     paper which was published in 1900 not 1990.

  2016-05-03
  1. Now check all options for the method argument so that only valid
    methods are allowed.

Version 2.3.1
  Changes
  2016-05-01
  1. Expanded test.interactions() to test many-to-one combinatorial
     interactions in C++ via Rcpp.

Version 2.3.0 (not deposited to CRAN)
  Changes
  2016-04-30
  1. Data frame input is now converted to numeric matrix before exact
     functional test.
  2. Added function test.interactions() to test pairwise (one-to-one)
     interactions, implemented in C++ via Rcpp for computational efficiency.

Version 2.2.4
  Changes
  2016-04-21
  1. Added vignette "Which statistic to use for functional dependency
     from fun.chisq.test()?"
  2. Updated references and description.

Version 2.2.3
  Changes
  2016-03-31
  1. Use [[Rcpp::export]] to automatically generate R interface.

  2016-03-15
  1. Revised the code to remove dependency on RcppClassic.

  2016-03-12
  1. Revised help documentation and included new references.

Version 2.2.2
  Changes
  2016-02-07
  1. Handled a special case for the normalized FunChisq when the degrees of
     freedom are zero.

  2016-02-05
  1. Renamed the "type" argument to "alternative" in fun.chisq.test().
  2. Revised values of the "method" argument in fun.chisq.test(). Previous
     values ("default" and "normalized") are still supported but obsolete.
  3. Added the "log.p" argument in both cp.fun.chisq.test() and cp.chisq.test().
  4. Updated the documentation.

  2016-01-30
  1. Added a new argument "index.kind" to fun.chisq.test() to specify
     the function index kind: "unconditional" or "conditional" on a given
     marginal of Y.

  2016-01-26
  1. Fixed a bug in cp.chisq.test().

Version 2.2.1
  Changes
  2016-01-25
  1. Fixed a bug introduced in the previous version.
  2. Updated package description to be more reflective of recent additions.
  3. Included missing references.

Version 2.2.0
  Changes
  2016-01-23
  1. Improved code efficiency for fun.chisq.test().
  2. Now fun.chisq.test() returns an estimate of function index between
     0 and 1, in analogy to Cramer's V, but asymmetrical.
  3. Added additional test examples for fun.chisq.test().

  2016-01-22
  1. Added type argument to fun.chisq.test() to specify functional or
     non-constant functional chi-squares.
  2. Added log.p argument to fun.chisq.test() to obtain log of p-value
     to improve accuracy when sample size is large and p-value is close
     to zero.

  2015-07-03 (Unpublished version 2.1.1 )
  1. Added cp.chisq.test() for comparative chi-square test, not considering
     functional dependencies.
  2. Added test examples for cp.chisq.test().

Version 2.1.0 2015-06-29
  Changes
  1. Substantially reduced the run time of exact functional test by designing a
     better branch and bound strategy.
  2. Enabled C++11 compling by adding two files (Makevars and Makevars.win).
  3. Fixed a bug occured under WIN32 using long double by adding define.h to
     specify double precision for WIN32 and long double precision for WIN64.
  4. Increased float comparison precision by considering a tolerance.
  5. Imported pnorm() and pchisq() from the "stats" package.

Version 2.0.2 2015-03-03
  Changes
  1. Updated documentation for the package and its functions.
  2. Fixed a testing issue under r-release-linux-ix86 flavor.

Version 2.0.1 2015-02-23
  Changes
  1. Removed assert() function from StatDistribution.cpp.
  2. Removed Makevar and Makevar.win files.
  3. Removed all iostream and sstream and cassert.
  4. Removed TransitionTableIO.cpp.
  5. In the testthat examples, signif(x,8) is used to compare 8 significant
     digits of the results.
  6. Added a normalized functional chi-square test example.

Version 2.0.0 2015-02-12
  Changes
  1. Added a new exact functional test as a method option to fun.chisq.test().
     The exact functional test is an exact version of FunChisq test, it is
     more precise to detect functional dependencies in small sample-sized
     contingency tables.
  2. Added a new comparative functional chi-square test for detecting
     heterogeneity in functional dependencies among contingency tables.
  3. Revised the examples and documentation to improve usability.
  4. Added automated test cases into the package.
  5. Started the NEWS file.

Version 1.0 2014-03-08
  Changes
  1. The first release of this package implements the functional chi-square
     test and a normalized version.
