FunChisq package

Version 2.0.0 (2015-02-15)
Changes
  1. Added a new exact functional test as an exact version of the asymptotic 
     functional chi-square test. It is more accurate to compute the statistical   
     significance of functional dependencies in small sample-sized 
     contingency tables. It can be called by setting the method option to
     "exact" in fun.chisq.test().
     
  2. Added a new function that implements a comparative functional chi-square
     test for detecting heterogeneity in functional dependencies among 
     contingency tables.
     
  3. Added new examples and revised previous examples to improve software 
     usability
  
  4. Rewrote documentation to improve clarity.

  5. Added automated test cases into the package.

  6. Started this NEWS file.
